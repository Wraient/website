# [Ametrine](https://ametrine.daudix.one)

> [!CAUTION]
> Ametrine is currently in the pre-alpha state and ***SHOULD NOT*** be used in production, it is not ready yet. Version 0.1.0 is on its way and should be released sometime soon, along with a migration guide from [Duckquill](https://duckquill.daudix.one). See [v0.1.0 To-do](https://codeberg.org/Geode/ametrine/issues/3).

[Zola](https://www.getzola.org) theme made specifically for personal websites and blogs. It provides good defaults and an easy configuration, while being somewhat flexible on demand. Its design is rather unique and changes from time to time, and the development pace is rather rapid.
