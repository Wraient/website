**Ametrine**, also known as **trystine, golden amethyst,** or by the trade name **bolivianite**, is a variety of [quartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz) with alternating zones of purple and yellow-orange coloration. Its name is a portmanteau of [amethyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amethyst) and [citrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrine_quartz). While ametrine is commonly referred to as a combination of these two quartz varieties, some sources claim this is not accurate.[^2] Almost all commercially available ametrine is mined in [Bolivia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolivia).
